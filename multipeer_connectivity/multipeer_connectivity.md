# What the press is saying

* hotel basement
* cave
* rural areas where cell tower connections are non-existent

* disaster area where cell towers have been knocked out

---

# What is it actually good for?

* Zero-config connectivity
* Realtime/Low-latency apps
* Proximity-based apps
* Connectivity in any environment
* No user permission required

---

# OK, ok, but give me *examples*!

* **In-person games:** board games, card games, realtime multiplayer games
* **In-person sharing:** conference app to share contact info, media browser app to quickly share pictures
* **Local triggers:** remote camera trigger
* **Push-To-Talk:** walkie-talkies are fun

# [fit] Demo Time!

# Downsides

* iOS 7 only
* No OSX support
* No support for Android/Windows/Windows Phone/etc.
* Nascent tech, rough edges
* Performance starts to degrade with # of connected clients
* Clients can take a long time to “disconnect”
