# Swift Panel

## This Year

* Go around the group and introduce ourselves
* Swift in history
* Swift Playgrounds on iPad: thoughts?
* Swift evolution
* Swift on non-Apple platforms: a very niche yet promising area of interest, when do you expect cross-platform Swift to reach a tipping point where it's seriously considered by a significat portion of the audience?
* Swift server side
* What's happened thanks for Swift now being developed in the open that likely wouldn't or couldn't have happened otherwise?
* What challenges has Swift being open source brought to the progression of the language, and how do you think those can be addressed moving forward?
* How would you recommend developers live with the constant flurry of changes in Swift?
* What would you recommend to developers looking to get more involved in Swift's evolution process?
* Erica Sadun has described Swift 1 as 'setting the baseline', 2 as 'protocol oriented programming & error handling' & 3 as 'clean house and break everything'. Would you agree with her characterizations?
* Swift 4: where do you see this going?

## Last Year

* Looking back, how would you characterize Swift's first year? How has the language and the community evolved in this short time?
* Apple has put a strong emphasis on quality and polish for their OSes this week. Do you think they struck the right balance between polish and new features for Swift?
* What was your favorite aspect of Swift in the last year? What do you think you'll enjoy the most in the coming months?
* Swift aims to strike a balance between functional and imperative programming. Did that balance shift this week?
* Apple focused on testing a lot this year: @testable was announced. Do you think this is going in the right direction?
* Do you think developers should be allowed to maintain their Swift 1.2 apps even after 2.0 ships? How should developers deal with all these Swift versions? How about framework maintainers? How about larger codebases?
* Apple's announced that they want to open source Swift by the end of the year. What do you think that will look like? How will this impact the direction of the language?
* The Swift community has a unique opportunity to help shape the direction of the language. Do you have any advice for developers, or maybe Apple, moving froward to help Swift reach its full potential?
