## The road to clean code with SwiftLint

# What is **SwiftLint?**

### A tool to enforce Swift style and conventions

![inline](screenshot.png)

* Integrates into Xcode
* Plugins for AppCode, Vim, Sublime Text, Atom, Emacs

---

# Philosophy ü§î

> :fire: Code style is largely **unimportant**! :fire:
<br/>
> Which is why it's _crucial_ to **let tools do the pedantic formatting checks**
<br/>
> Allowing you to focus on more important aspects of writing code and building apps!

# **Reasons** People Use **SwiftLint**

* Intra-Project Consistency
* Inter-Project Consistency
* Helping Beginners Avoid Bad Practices
* Readability
* Avoiding Style Debates
* Specific Style Choices

# Rules

* 60 rules
* 16 opt-in
* 19 correctable
* 19 configurable settings

---

# **Stylistic** Rules

* **Attributes:** Rules to place attributes like `@objc` and `@testable`
* **Closure Parameter Position:** Where to place closure parameters
* **Syntactic Sugar:** Use syntactic sugar types: `[Int]` vs `Array<Int>`
* **Trailing Comma:** Avoid/Require trailing commas: `[1,2,3,]`
* **Empty Parentheses Trailing Closure:** `[].map() {}` vs `[].map {}`
* **Implicit Getter:** Read-only properties avoid using the `get` keyword

---

# **Hygienic** Rules

* **Function Body Length**
* **Type Body Length**
* **Line Length**
* **File Length**
* Name rules lengths

---

# **Convention** Rules

* **Empty Parameters:** Prefer `() ->` over `Void ->`
* **Void Return:** Prefer `-> Void` over `-> ()`
* **Legacy Constant:** Prefer `CGRect.infinite` over `CGRectInfinite`
* **Comma Spacing:** No space before and one after
* **Colon:** Should be next to the identifier when specifying a type
* **Type Name** / **Variable Name**

---

# **Code Smells** Rules (üî™üê¥)

* **Force Try**
* **Force Unwrapping**
* **Force Cast**
* **Function Parameter Count:** Too many parameters might be a sign you should use a type to encapsulate
* **Cyclomatic Complexity:** Too high might be hard to reason about
* **Nesting:** Don't nest types/statements too deeply: Pyramid of **DOOM**

---

# **Bug Avoiding** Rules

* **Dynamic Inline:** `@dynamic` with `@inline(__always)` is undefined
* **Empty Count:** Prefer `isEmpty` over comparing `count` to 0
* **Weak Delegate:** Delegates should be weak to avoid reference cycles
* **Valid IBInspectable**
* **Private Unit Test**
* **Private Outlets**

---

# [fit] **Great**
# [fit] Rules :+1:

---

# **Empty Parameters** Rule

```swift
// Triggers
let abc: Void -> Void = {}
func foo(completion: Void -> Void)
func foo(completion: Void throws -> Void)
let foo: Void -> () throws -> Void)
// Corrections
let abc: () -> Void = {}
func foo(completion: () -> Void)
func foo(completion: () throws -> Void)
let foo: () -> () throws -> Void)
```

---

# **Void Return** Rule

```swift
// Triggers
let abc: () -> () = {}
func foo(completion: () -> ())
func foo(completion: () -> (   ))
let foo: (ConfigurationTests) -> () throws -> ())
// Corrections
let abc: () -> Void = {}
func foo(completion: () -> Void)
func foo(completion: () -> Void)
let foo: (ConfigurationTests) -> () throws -> Void)
```

---

# **Legacy CGGeometry** Rule

```swift
// Triggers
CGRectIsInfinite( rect )
CGRectStandardize( rect)
CGRectIntegral(rect )
CGRectInset(rect, 5.0, -7.0)
CGRectOffset(rect, -2, 8.3)
CGRectUnion(rect1, rect2)
CGRectIntersection( rect1 ,rect2)
// Corrections
rect.isInfinite
rect.standardized
rect.integral
rect.insetBy(dx: 5.0, dy: -7.0)
rect.offsetBy(dx: -2, dy: 8.3)
rect1.union(rect2)
rect1.intersect(rect2)
```

---

# **Closing Brace Spacing** Rule

```swift
// Triggers
[].map( { } )
// Corrections
[].map({ })
```

---

# [fit] **No So Great**
<br/>
# [fit] Rules :-1:

---

# **Opt-In** Rules

* A rule that can have many false positives (e.g. `empty_count`)
* A rule that is too slow
* A rule that is not general consensus or only useful in some cases (e.g. `force_unwrapping`, `missing_docs`)

---

# **Custom** Rules

```yaml
comments_space: # From https://github.com/brandenr/swiftlintconfig
    name: "Space After Comment"
    regex: "(^ *//\w+)"
    message: "There should be a space after //"
    severity: error
force_https: # From https://github.com/Twigz/Game
    name: "Force HTTPS over HTTP"
    regex: "((?i)http(?!s))"
    match_kinds: string
    message: "HTTPS should be favored over HTTP"
    severity: warning
double_space: # From https://github.com/IBM-Swift/Package-Builder
    include: "*.swift"
    name: "Double space"
    regex: "([a-z,A-Z] \s+)"
    message: "Double space between keywords"
    match_kinds: keyword
    severity: warning
```

---

# [fit] **Configuration:** `.swiftlint.yml`

```yaml
disabled_rules: # rule identifiers to exclude from running
  - colon
  - comma
  - control_statement
opt_in_rules: # some rules are only opt-in
  - empty_count
  - missing_docs
  # Find all the available rules by running:
  # swiftlint rules
included: # paths to include during linting. `--path` is ignored if present.
  - Source
excluded: # paths to ignore during linting. Takes precedence over `included`.
  - Carthage
  - Pods
  - Source/ExcludedFolder
  - Source/ExcludedFile.swift
```

Sample configuration settings

# Commands

```swift
/**** Regions ****/
// swiftlint:disable colon
let noWarning :String = ""
// swiftlint:enable colon
let hasWarning :String = ""
/**** Local ****/
// swiftlint:disable:next force_cast
let noWarning = NSNumber() as! Int
let hasWarning = NSNumber() as! Int
let noWarning2 = NSNumber() as! Int // swiftlint:disable:this force_cast
let noWarning3 = NSNumber() as! Int
// swiftlint:disable:previous force_cast
```

---

# Enforcement

* Xcode Build Phase
* Use in AppCode, Vim, Sublime Text, Atom, Emacs
* Travis has SwiftLint installed on their Xcode images
* Jenkins
* Hound CI
* HTML reporter

# **Usage** Strategies

* The **Incremental** Code **Stylist**
* The **Skeptic**
* The **Completionist**
* The **Commander** In **Chief**
* The **Vagabond**
* The **Sniper**

---

# The **Incremental** Code **Stylist**

* Start with lots of rules disabled or very loose thresholds
* Start with a small portion of your code base
* Slowly start fixing violations & enabling those rules
* Great for larger teams or projects

# The **Skeptic**

* You "don't believe" in linters :wink:
* ...or rather the value they add to your project
* Just enable the most reliable / obvious of rules

![](skeptic.jpg)

# The **Completionist**

* ENABLE ALL THE RULES!
* RUIN YOUR CODE TO CONFORM TO ALL RULES!
* LINT EVERY SINGLE FILE IN YOUR PROJECT!
* LINT ALL DAY EVERY DAY!
* ...srsly don't do dis... :pray:
* Just because a rule exists doesn't mean you should use it

![](completionist.jpg)

# The **Commander** In **Chief**

* Use comment commands liberally throughout your code
    * `// swiftlint:disable one_rule_here`
    * `// swiftlint:enable another_rule_there`
* Doing this a little is fine
* Doing this a lot won't help you get the consistency in your project you're after

![](commander.jpg)

---

# The **Vagabond**

* Occasionally revisit running SwiftLint on your code
* This is great if you don't want the burden and churn of always linting
* Of if you're prototyping something / exploring ideas and don't want distractions
* Can do this with SwiftLint as a whole, or with specific rules
* An additional config file is great for this: `.swiftlint_hard_mode.yml`

![](vagabond.jpg)

---

# The **Sniper**

* Just enable a small number of very specific rules in your project to prevent very specific bugs to creep in
* Don't need to be bothered with pesky style rules
* You're a style master, always consistent, always readable code... or just don't care ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

# Don't Bend To The **Will Of The Machines**

```swift
// Persist your data easily
let realm = try! Realm()
try! realm.write {
  realm.add(mydog)
}
```

> **User Comment:** _Its kind of ironic that Realm's first example in docs does not work with swiftlint._
